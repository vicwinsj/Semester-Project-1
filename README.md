# Semester Project 1 – "Science Fosen"

![image](https://github.com/vicwinsj/Semester-Project-1/assets/105510116/6955b69c-50ea-45f1-a4eb-7ad059514875)

This project was to simulate a real-world brief that I may receive from a web agency. The aim was to use my new knowledge of project planning, web design and development to complete the brief in the available time. This was in the first year of my 2 year long study at the online school of Noroff, Front-end Development.

## Description

Add a more detailed description of what your project entails and set out to do.

Client:

I was supposed to:

- A visitor can view a contact page showing the museum's address, phone number, opening hours and contact form.
- A visitor can view a contribution showing information on how to contribute to the museum.
